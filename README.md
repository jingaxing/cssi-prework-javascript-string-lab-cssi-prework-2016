# String Manipulation - L337

Since you are gaining entry into the nerd universe, it's time to learn l33t (leet). l33t is encoding of sorts that manipulates strings using certain rules [l33t on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet).

For this lab, we will basic l33t rules.
1. Substitute the vowels a,e,i and o.
 * a becomes 4
 * e becomes 3
 * i becomes 1
 * o becomes 0

2. Replace all whitespace with a `$`.


## Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in the browser to see your functions in action! Don't forget to open the JavaScript console to see any messages. Press the "l33t It" button and you'll see the encoder is not working.

2. In `js/encoder.js` follow the instructions in the comments to translate userString into basic l33t.



## Example

For instance, say we built a encoder method that changed letters that resembled numbers into numbers, subbed whitespace for dollar signs, and then reversed the order of the string. The string "the great gatsby" would become "y65ta8$ta3r8$3ht".
