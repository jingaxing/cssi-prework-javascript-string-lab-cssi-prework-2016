# String Manipulation - L337

Since you are gaining entry into the nerd universe, it's time to learn l33t (leet). l33t is encoding of sorts that manipulates strings using certain rules [l33t on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet).

For this lab, we will 2 basic l33t rules.

1. Substitute the vowels a,e,i and o.
 * a becomes 4
 * e becomes 3
 * i becomes 1
 * o becomes 0

2. Replace all whitespace with a `$`.


## Instructions
1. Open `index.html` in the browser to see your functions in action! You can do this by using the command line or by using Finder. Don't forget to open the JavaScript console to see any messages. Press the "l33t It" button and you'll see the encoder just returns the original `userString`.

2. Open `encoder.js`. Follow the instructions in the comments to translate userString into basic l33t.
